Voice-Activated Text Generation with Mistral

This project utilizes speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies to interact with the Mistral text generation model via an API. Users can speak prompts, which are then processed, sent to the Mistral model, and the generated text is returned and spoken aloud.

Once the project is set up, you can use it as follows:

After processing your speech, Mistral will generate text based on your prompt.

The generated text will be spoken aloud, providing an audio response to your prompt.
